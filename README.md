## Operation
Videos files need to be dragged and dropped to play in the program. Currently features a basic pause button
and a timeline for skipping around in the video. The player can actually play audio files as well I was thinking
it could display some kind of image to tell the user it's playing audio.

## Bugs
* Play/Pause button seems to stop working after the program is on for a while
* Moving forward or backwards on the timeline while the video is playing doesn't work correctly, this is especially noticable in long videos
* Does not appear to support mkv files. 
* Player has to be closed in order to load another media file. 
* Window does not scale properly

## To Do (At the moment)
* Fix Bugs
* Add Skip Feature
* Add Playback speed adjustment
* Add Volume Control
* Allow a file search
* Improve the UI
* Pressing the play/pause button after the video is over should reset it
* Playback features need to hide themselves after a few seconds of not being used.
